# AthenaLink Portal

**Status:** Work in Progress

AthenaLink Portal is a React-based web application designed to simulate a futuristic, Star Wars-inspired research database interface. The project demonstrates how a sleek user interface can integrate advanced search functionality, dynamic animations, and AI-driven data retrieval in the cloud. While still under development, it provides a strong foundation for future AWS integration and AI-powered content analysis.

## **Project Objective**

The primary goal of AthenaLink Portal is to create an interactive, visually immersive front-end for exploring research articles. Users can input search filters such as:

- Research Topic  
- Publication Year  
- Author Name  
- Institution  

Upon initiating a search, the portal triggers a hyperspace-style animation reminiscent of lightspeed in Star Wars, signaling the retrieval of data. Currently, the application uses placeholder results to demonstrate the UI flow, with plans to integrate AWS S3 for storing research metadata and AI services for intelligent search.

## **Key Features**

- **Dynamic Starfield Background:** Creates an immersive space-themed interface.  
- **Hyperspace Animation:** Engages users with lightspeed-style transitions during searches.  
- **Responsive Search Interface:** Accepts multiple filters and displays results in a clean, readable format.  
- **Placeholder Results:** Demonstrates front-end functionality before backend integration.  
- **React & Framer Motion:** Uses modern web development libraries for a smooth, interactive experience.

## **Technology Stack**

- **React.js** – Front-end framework for building dynamic user interfaces.  
- **Framer Motion** – Animation library used to create the hyperspace lightspeed effect.  
- **AWS S3 (Planned)** – Cloud storage for research metadata and results.  
- **AWS AI Services (Planned)** – For intelligent analysis and retrieval of relevant content.  
- **CSS / Tailwind (optional)** – For styling and responsive design.

## **Future Development**

- Connect the search functionality to an AWS backend that stores research article metadata in S3.  
- Use AI to analyze and extract relevant information from stored articles.  
- Implement email notifications to deliver search results directly to users.  
- Enhance visuals with particle effects and advanced CSS animations to improve the immersive experience.
