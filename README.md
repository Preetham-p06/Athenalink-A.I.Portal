# AthenaLink Portal

**Status:** Work in Progress  

AthenaLink Portal is a React-based web application designed to simulate a futuristic research database interface. The project showcases how a sleek front-end can combine immersive visuals, advanced search functionality, and smooth animations. While still in development, the foundation is set for future AWS integration and AI-powered data retrieval.

## **Project Objective**

The goal of AthenaLink Portal is to build an interactive, visually immersive platform for exploring research articles. Users can filter searches by:

- Research Topic  
- Publication Year  
- Author Name  
- Institution  

When a search is initiated, the portal plays a hyperspace-style animation before displaying results. Currently, the results are placeholders to demonstrate the interface flow, with future plans to connect to an AWS backend for real research metadata.

## **Key Features**

- **Dynamic Starfield Background** – Creates a space-inspired visual environment.  
- **Hyperspace Animation** – Lightspeed transition effect during searches.  
- **Responsive Search UI** – Accepts multiple filters and displays structured results.  
- **Placeholder Results** – Showcases UI functionality before backend integration.  
- **Built with React & Framer Motion** – Ensures smooth transitions and modern interaction.

## **Technology Stack**

- **React.js** – Front-end framework for dynamic UI development.  
- **Framer Motion** – Animation library powering hyperspace effects.  
- **AWS S3 (Planned)** – For storing and retrieving research metadata.  
- **AWS AI Services (Planned)** – For semantic search and intelligent filtering.  
- **Tailwind CSS (Optional)** – For responsive styling and design consistency.
